# Our Open Source Contributions

This is a practice repository for anyone who wants to try out the open source
collaboration workflow before jumping into a "real" open source project. Feel free
to make some commits and a PR! For example, you could add to our list of
goals or share something you learned today, right here in this README. Any files
can be edited :)

## How to get started

A full list of step-by-step instructions for your first pull request
can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

To run files locally:
```
npm install http-server -g
http-server
```

## My goals are...
- do more PR reviews in the projects I help maintain @jenweber

## One thing I learned today...
- how to run a simple http server without using Python @jenweber
